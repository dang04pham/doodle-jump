        <p>Doodle Jump was renowned for its selling rate by App Store standards, which counted 25,000 copies sold daily
            for 4 consecutive months (later overtaken by Angry Birds). As of December, 2011, the game sold 10 million
            copies over iTunes and Google Play and reached 15 million downloads across all platforms. The game has been
            developed into a video redemption game for play at video arcades. Croats Igor and Marko Pu≈°enjak are authors
            of Doodle Jump, where Igor works from a New York-based address and Marko resides in Croatia. In July 2016,
            Lima Sky announced partnership with Skillz to develop a tournament-playable version of the game.

    <h1 id="title">Gameplay</h1>
    <p class="gameplay"> In Doodle Jump, the aim is to guide a four-legged creature called "The Doodler" up a
        never-ending series of platforms without falling. The left side of the playing field is connected with the right
        side. For devices with an accelerometer, players tilt the device from side to side to move the Doodler in the
        desired direction. Players can get a short boost from various objects, such as propeller hats, jetpacks,
        rockets, springs, trampolines and invulnerability shields (some levels only). There are also monsters and UFOs
        that the Doodler must avoid, shoot, or jump on to eliminate. Aiming is performed by tapping on different parts
        of the screen, on the Android and Windows Phone versions of the game there is also an automatic aim mode.
        Depending on the game mode being played, projectiles may fly in a straight line off the screen or be affected by
        gravity and fall downwards. There is no definitive end to the game, but the end for each gameplay session
        happens when the player falls to the bottom of the screen, jumps into a monster, gets sucked into a black hole,
        or is abducted by a UFO. Players can choose from several different themes including Original, Christmas,
        Halloween, Rainforest, Space, Soccer World Cup, Underwater, Easter, Ice Blizzard, Retro Arcade, Ninja or Pirate.
        The themes change the look of the Doodle Jumper, his enemies, and the background. In the Ninja, Pirate,
        Halloween, and Easter modes, the player can buy new skins and extra lives with coins that can be earned in
        gameplay but may also be purchased. Furthermore, the player may enter the names of one of the Pocket God pygmies
        and the Doodler will turn into one of pygmies. Alternatively, the player can enter the name "Bunny" and the
        Doodler will wear a bunny suit, just like the one in the Easter stage.

        There are also two other separate apps for iPhone OS, Doodle Jump Christmas Special (a new Christmas theme) and
        Doodle Jump Hop, (a new Easter theme) where the player character is E.B. from the movie Hop.

        A free version also exists. This version is nearly identical to the original, but features such as UFOs are not
        present, advertisements are shown and there is a limit to how high the Doodler goes.</p>
